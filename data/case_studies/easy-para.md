How EasyPara Increased Its Average Basket Size by 200% with Scalapay

Introduction

EasyPara, a leading online parapharmacy, offers more than 30,000 products from 1,000 cosmetic and pharmaceutical brands, including La Roche-Posay, Bioderma, Nuxe, Caudalie, and Vichy. As part of its brand transformation strategy in a highly competitive market, EasyPara sought innovative ways to enhance customer experience and drive sales.

One of the key initiatives in this rebranding effort was the introduction of flexible payment solutions. Given EasyPara’s mission to make wellness accessible at fair prices, integrating a Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) option was a natural step to align with evolving consumer expectations and shopping habits.

	•	Reinforce its brand positioning as an affordable wellness and beauty destination.
	•	Increase conversion rates and average order value.
	•	Improve customer acquisition and retention.

The Solution: Integrating Scalapay

To meet these objectives, EasyPara integrated Scalapay’s BNPL solution, allowing customers to split their payments into multiple installments. This initiative not only made purchases more accessible but also provided a competitive edge in the online parapharmacy sector.
