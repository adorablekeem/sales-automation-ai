How Robin Collection Increased Online Orders by 67% with Scalapay

Introduction

Robin Collection, a swimwear fashion brand, has experienced significant growth since partnering with Scalapay in 2023. The brand, which sells internationally through its e-commerce platform and leading European marketplaces, needed a Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) solution to eliminate payment barriers and enhance the shopping experience.

After testing another BNPL provider that did not meet expectations, Robin Collection transitioned to Scalapay, leading to increased conversion rates, higher order values, and improved customer engagement.

The Challenge: Reducing Friction at Checkout

Robin Collection recognized that a smooth and efficient checkout process is crucial for driving online sales. Many consumers, particularly younger shoppers, abandon their carts when faced with high upfront costs, making payment flexibility a key factor in conversion.

Sandra Prieto, E-commerce & Marketing Manager at Robin Collection, explains:

	“For us, putting the customer first and removing obstacles at checkout has always been a top priority. Our swimwear holds a strong aspirational value, particularly among younger consumers, so offering flexible payment options was essential to capturing and converting this audience. That’s why our campaign last season was:
‘Enjoy it now, pay later.’”

Initially, Robin Collection implemented a different BNPL provider but found that it did not fully align with their customer needs and business goals. Seeking a more tailored and user-friendly approach, they switched to Scalapay.

The Scalapay Solution

	“Beyond the advantages of installment payments, the purchasing process with Scalapay is straightforward, transparent, and intuitive. Customers receive clear reminders about their upcoming payments, and since implementing Scalapay, we have not encountered any customer issues.”

The onboarding and integration process was fast and efficient, allowing Robin Collection to roll out BNPL payments without disrupting its operations.

Leveraging Co-Marketing with Scalapay

Robin Collection’s marketing strategy heavily relies on social media to engage and attract new customers. Scalapay actively supported the brand’s visibility through co-marketing initiatives by leveraging:
	•	A community of over 6 million active users
	•	1.8 million newsletter subscribers
	•	150,000+ social media followers

Through these campaigns, Robin Collection expanded its reach, increased engagement, and strengthened its customer acquisition strategy.

Results After Implementing Scalapay

Since integrating Scalapay, Robin Collection has recorded:
	•	67% increase in online orders compared to the previous year
	•	57% higher adoption rate compared to the previous BNPL provider
	•	9% increase in average order value for transactions using Scalapay

Conclusion

Understanding the importance of payment flexibility, Robin Collection took a proactive approach to enhancing the checkout experience. After facing limitations with their previous BNPL provider, switching to Scalapay became a turning point.

With Scalapay’s seamless integration, intuitive interface, and strong co-marketing support, Robin Collection has not only seen a sharp rise in orders but also strengthened customer satisfaction and loyalty.
