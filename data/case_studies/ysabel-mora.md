Introduction

Ysabel Mora, a fashion brand with over 35 years of international experience, specializes in intimate apparel, homewear, and swimwear. Operating in over 42 countries, the company continuously adapts to evolving consumer needs.

We spoke with Álvaro Latorre, Head of E-Commerce B2C & Digital Business at Ysabel Mora, to explore the brand’s decision to integrate Scalapay’s BNPL solution and the impact it has had on their business.

The Evolving E-Commerce Landscape

The e-commerce industry has transformed significantly in recent years, especially following the pandemic. As the market becomes more competitive, brands like Ysabel Mora recognize the need for flexible payment solutions that cater to a diverse customer base.

Why Payment Flexibility Matters

To increase conversion rates, brands must focus on:
	•	Website experience optimization
	•	A seamless checkout process
	•	Offering diverse and preferred payment methods

According to Álvaro Latorre, payment options play a critical role in differentiating an e-commerce brand from its competitors:
“It’s essential to offer a seamless, fast checkout experience with the most in-demand payment options. Scalapay not only increases conversions but also elevates the overall shopping experience. Customers feel empowered to buy more, knowing they have a flexible, interest-free payment option.”

Key Trends in E-Commerce

As consumer behavior evolves, personalized experiences and AI-driven recommendations are becoming the new standard. Álvaro notes several major trends:
	•	Personalization: Shoppers expect curated recommendations tailored to their preferences.
	•	Emerging Technologies: AI and virtual reality are reshaping how customers interact with products online.
	•	Sustainability & Ethical Shopping: Modern consumers prioritize brand responsibility and transparency.
	•	Payment Flexibility as a Standard: BNPL is no longer an optional feature—it’s an expected payment method for online shoppers.

“Consumers today demand flexibility. They don’t just prefer BNPL; they expect it. The ability to choose how and when to pay creates a frictionless, user-friendly experience, making BNPL an essential offering for any retailer.”

The Scalapay Solution

Ysabel Mora integrated Scalapay’s Pay-in-Three option to allow customers to split payments into three monthly installments.

Why Scalapay?
	•	Effortless Checkout: A simple and intuitive payment experience.
	•	Seamless Integration: Ysabel Mora, which operates on Shopify, implemented Scalapay quickly and efficiently.
	•	Dedicated Account Support: Scalapay provides ongoing performance analysis and co-marketing opportunities.

“Scalapay presents itself as an easy, flexible payment option, and its integration was just as smooth. Having dedicated support has been invaluable for tracking performance and collaborating on marketing campaigns.”

Customer Response

According to Álvaro Latorre, shoppers have embraced the Buy Now, Pay Later model:
“Our customers appreciate the ability to split payments, especially during peak shopping seasons like Christmas. It makes purchasing more accessible while allowing them to take advantage of seasonal promotions without immediate financial strain.”

The Results

Ysabel Mora has seen significant business growth since integrating Scalapay:
	•	+20% increase in average order value
	•	+20% increase in items per cart
	•	+5% increase in repeat purchase rate

“We’ve observed a higher average spend per customer, and even when we launch new collections, this spending remains stable. Scalapay has undoubtedly contributed to our sustained growth.”

Conclusion

The easier and more adaptable payment options are, the more confident customers feel when purchasing.

*“Optimizing checkout isn’t just about convenience; it’s about removing every possible friction point. You can have the best product recommendations and the most engaging online store, but if the payment process isn’t optimized, you risk losing conversions.

Scalapay not only increases conversion rates but enhances customer satisfaction. It’s a must-have solution for any retailer looking to improve the shopping experience, boost sales, and drive long-term growth.”*
