How Coin Doubled Its Average Ticket Size with Scalapay

Introduction

Coin, a leading retail and e-commerce brand, has seen significant growth in both online and in-store transactions since partnering with Scalapay in 2021. Over the past few years, Coin has successfully leveraged Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) solutions to enhance its customer experience and drive sales.

We spoke with Giovanni Pace, Head of Retail at Coin, to discuss how Scalapay’s BNPL solution is shaping the retail and e-commerce landscape in 2024 and the key trends influencing consumer behavior.

Coin: A Retail and E-Commerce Powerhouse

Coin is a renowned Italian retail brand, offering a curated selection of fashion, beauty, and home decor products. With stores across Italy and a growing e-commerce presence, Coin serves as a go-to shopping destination for urban consumers.

Each Coin store is designed to provide an engaging and premium shopping experience, featuring top-tier brands that blend innovation, luxury, and accessibility. Beyond fashion and beauty, Coincasa, the brand’s home decor line, offers a wide range of stylish interior products.

Retail Challenges in a Post-Pandemic Landscape

In today’s rapidly evolving retail space, brands like Coin must navigate complex challenges while staying ahead of shifting consumer preferences.

One of the biggest hurdles has been adapting to a diverse customer base that spans five distinct generations:
	•	Baby Boomers (1946-1964)
	•	Gen X (1965-1980)
	•	Millennials (Gen Y) (1981-1996)
	•	Gen Z (1997-2012)
	•	Gen Alpha (2013-present)

Each generation has unique shopping behaviors, preferences, and expectations. Simply investing in digital marketing and advertising is no longer enough—brands must rethink their commercial strategies, embrace the latest technologies, and ensure a seamless omnichannel experience.

Giovanni Pace on the Evolution of Consumer Expectations:

“Consumers today don’t just buy products; they seek an immersive shopping experience with brands they trust. They are more informed, selective, and expect a seamless journey—both online and in-store. Partnering with companies that share these values is crucial, and that’s where Scalapay plays a fundamental role.”

The Scalapay Solution

Coin integrated Scalapay’s BNPL solution in December 2021, allowing customers to split payments into three interest-free installments. Following the successful online adoption, the retailer expanded Scalapay to in-store purchases, ensuring a frictionless experience across all channels.

Why Scalapay?
	•	Enhanced Customer Experience: Younger consumers demand seamless, tech-friendly payment solutions. Scalapay meets these expectations with an intuitive, user-friendly experience.
	•	Higher Purchase Power: By offering flexible payments, Coin has increased conversion rates and customer spending.
	•	Fast & Simple Integration: Scalapay’s efficient onboarding process ensured a smooth rollout across Coin’s digital and physical stores.

The Results: A Significant Boost in Sales & Customer Engagement

Since integrating Scalapay, Coin has achieved remarkable business growth, including:
	•	2X revenue growth in just one year.
	•	Average ticket size more than doubled compared to other payment methods.
	•	68% of Scalapay orders come from users already familiar with the BNPL solution—customers who have used Scalapay with other merchants and returned to shop at Coin.

“With Scalapay, we’ve seen outstanding results. In just one year, our revenue doubled, and we’ve observed a significant increase in customer confidence and repeat purchases. The ability to pay in installments has directly contributed to an increase in average ticket size, which is now twice as high compared to other payment methods.”

The Future of Retail: Putting Consumers First

As shopping behaviors continue to evolve, retailers must redefine their strategies to meet modern customer expectations.

In 2024, brands must ask themselves:
	•	Who provides the fastest, smoothest shopping experience?
	•	Which brands recognize consumers as individuals, catering to their unique preferences?

Scalapay & Coin’s partnership demonstrates that brands investing in customer-centric solutions—particularly in the payments space—are the ones driving success in today’s economy.

Giovanni Pace on the Role of Technology in Retail:

“Retailers must avoid the mistake of thinking technology alone can replace the human touch. The real value lies in how technology enhances the overall shopping experience. The success of Coin’s partnership with Scalapay comes from the perfect balance between innovative payment technology and a deeply customer-centric retail experience.”

By embracing flexible payments, investing in consumer trust, and adapting to emerging trends, Coin continues to set the standard for modern retail success.
