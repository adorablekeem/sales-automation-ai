How Futbol Factory Achieved €200K in Additional Revenue with Scalapay

Introduction

Futbol Factory has been a Scalapay partner since June 2023. Over the past year, their e-commerce platform has benefited significantly from offering our Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) solution to customers. We interviewed Alvaro del Valle, Head of E-commerce and Marketing at Futbol Factory, to understand what motivated them to collaborate with Scalapay and the impact of our partnership so far.

About Futbol Factory

Founded in 2000, Futbol Factory has over 20 years of history, dedicated to providing football fans and players with the best products both in-store and online, ensuring they can fully embrace their passion for the sport.

As a sports-focused marketplace, Futbol Factory faces two main challenges:
	1.	Product Quality & Market Alignment – The company ensures that they source top-quality products from leading brands at the right time while maintaining competitive pricing.
	2.	Optimized Customer Experience – Creating a seamless shopping journey, from product selection to checkout, is critical for customer satisfaction and conversion.

Why Futbol Factory Chose Scalapay

One of the biggest challenges in e-commerce is optimizing the checkout process to reduce friction and cart abandonment. Futbol Factory had already integrated traditional payment methods (bank transfer, cash on delivery, credit/debit cards) and mobile payment solutions (Google Pay, Apple Pay). However, they wanted to go further.

	“We asked ourselves: why not offer an installment payment solution with no minimum amount and no fees? Scalapay became our ideal partner in 2023.”
— Alvaro del Valle, Head of E-commerce & Marketing, Futbol Factory

The Solution

In June 2023, Futbol Factory implemented Scalapay’s 3-installment payment option, allowing customers to split their payments into three monthly installments. This increased purchasing power and accessibility, driving higher conversions.

Despite having a custom e-commerce platform, the integration process was quick and seamless, as described by Alvaro del Valle:

	“From our first call with Scalapay to receiving our first BNPL order, only 15 days passed. The API integration with our custom CMS, the smooth collaboration between both IT teams, and the user-friendly back office for tracking transactions made the process incredibly simple.”

The Results

After integrating Scalapay, Futbol Factory achieved significant milestones within the first six months of the partnership:
	•	2,000+ customers chose Scalapay to pay for their orders on futbolfactory.es.
	•	€200,000+ in additional revenue generated through Scalapay transactions.
	•	41% of orders made with Scalapay came from returning customers who had previously used BNPL with other merchants on the Scalapay network.
