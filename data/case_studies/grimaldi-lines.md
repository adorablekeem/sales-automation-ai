Scalapay Drives Innovation in Tourism: The Grimaldi Lines Case Study

Introduction

Grimaldi Lines, one of Italy’s leading maritime operators, has established a strong presence across major Mediterranean routes and continues to experience significant growth. The partnership with Scalapay began as a digital payment initiative aimed at enhancing customer convenience. Over time, it has evolved into a strategic collaboration focused on co-growth, co-marketing, and financial flexibility.

The Role of BNPL in Travel & Tourism

Flexibility, co-marketing, and digitalization are the three key pillars shaping Scalapay’s expansion into the travel and transportation industry. 2023 was a transformative year for BNPL adoption in tourism, with more than 10 million Italians integrating it into their purchasing habits. In the travel sector, particularly among transportation providers and tour operators, the demand for Buy Now, Pay Later has surged, with over 30% of consumers actively seeking this payment option.

Challenges Faced by Grimaldi Lines

Grimaldi Lines continuously invests in online and offline marketing to enhance the traveler’s journey and streamline the booking process, particularly for higher-ticket purchases. Despite these efforts, the company recognized a need for:
	•	More accessible payment options for travelers booking long-distance routes.
	•	Faster and smoother checkout experiences, reducing friction at the point of purchase.
	•	Digital innovation to remain competitive in a fast-evolving travel industry.

Since November 2022, Scalapay’s interest-free installment solution has been integrated into Grimaldi Lines’ booking system, offering travelers greater financial flexibility.

Francesca Marino, Head of Passenger Department at Grimaldi Lines:

“A financial solution as innovative as Scalapay’s Buy Now, Pay Later is a true revolution for our industry. It simplifies booking ferry trips and makes travel accessible to more people. Now, after more than a year of partnership, I can confidently say that the ability to split payments into three installments has become one of the most appreciated and widely used options by our customers.”

The Scalapay Solution

Scalapay’s 5.5 million+ users benefit from its broad ecosystem, including brand partnerships and co-marketing initiatives. Grimaldi Lines has leveraged Scalapay’s marketing resources to:
	•	Launch seasonal travel promotions, targeting high-demand routes during peak and off-peak seasons.
	•	Run exclusive BNPL campaigns, advertised across social media, content creators, and digital channels.
	•	Offer time-sensitive promotions to incentivize Scalapay users to book their trips with Grimaldi Lines.

Francesca Marino on the Impact of Co-Marketing:

“Throughout 2023, we launched several co-marketing campaigns, offering exclusive promotions to travelers who selected Scalapay at checkout. The results were consistently impressive, reinforcing the effectiveness of BNPL in the travel sector.”

Results: Increased Transactions & Customer Engagement

The collaboration between Scalapay and Grimaldi Lines led to immediate and measurable growth:
	•	146.13% increase in total transaction volume through Scalapay.
	•	122.65% increase in the number of bookings using BNPL.
	•	10.67% rise in average ticket value, as travelers opted for higher-value bookings and additional services.
	•	58% of orders from Scalapay users were first-time Grimaldi Lines customers, acquired through co-marketing campaigns.

Why Travelers Prefer BNPL for Booking

Consumers increasingly value the ability to choose when and how to pay, without financial strain. This flexibility allows travelers to:
	•	Upgrade their travel experience, adding services such as premium cabins or onboard amenities.
	•	Book longer or more frequent trips, spreading costs over multiple months.
	•	Reduce the immediate financial burden, making high-ticket purchases more manageable.

“The ability to book a trip and split payments into interest-free installments enables our customers to spend more comfortably, adding value to their journey. We’ve observed that passengers using Scalapay tend to invest more in their travel experience compared to those who pay upfront in a single transaction.”

Conclusion: The Future of BNPL in Travel

According to Scalapay’s consumer insights, the typical BNPL travel customer is a young family (ages 35-45) that prefers flexible payment options over lump-sum transactions.

With over 500,000 travelers already using Scalapay for vacations, the demand for BNPL in tourism is expected to double by 2024, further solidifying its role in the digital transformation of the travel industry.

As Scalapay continues to expand its presence in the transportation and tourism sectors, partnerships like Grimaldi Lines highlight how BNPL is not only a payment method but also a growth enabler, helping brands attract new customers, increase transaction values, and enhance customer satisfaction.
