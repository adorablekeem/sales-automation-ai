Challenges in E-Commerce

The luxury fashion market is highly competitive, and acquiring new customers is becoming increasingly expensive. To stand out and build long-term customer loyalty, retailers must go beyond product offerings and create added value.

Scalapay helped FRMODA overcome these challenges by providing flexible, interest-free installment payments. This made luxury items more accessible to a broader audience, expanded market reach, and increased the number of items per order. Additionally, BNPL improved customer retention by offering greater financial flexibility.
